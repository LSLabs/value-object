Test methods have to be divided in the following four phases:
// arrange [ON]
// act [WHEN]
// assert [RETURNS/SETS/DOES]
// teardown

Test methods have to be named in the following format:
methodName_ON_arranged_state_WHEN_action_executed_RETURNS/SETS/DOES_assertion

Meaningless formulations like "ON constructed" or "WHEN called" are not allowed.
